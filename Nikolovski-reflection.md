**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session**
*I won't say i was struggling because we had Guide who would answer questions, btw she was pretty helpfull and so was my pair, but i was confused and still not clarified why and how Merge Confict happened i mean we typed the wrong  command  maybe but hey ...i am still searching for an answer.*

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
* First i have to mention i didn't know how to add my pair as a collaborator , so we did that after we created the repo,  i have never done it so gotta say that was clarified for me :)),...Create, clone a repository , create a feature branch in git, make new file,  add and save then push the branch, then pull the repo and merge, and of course the navigator had to fetch them to his computer as well so he did fetch the file and merge the changes locally . Then we create another branch , make some changes to the same file then add and commit that push the changes online again and pull and merge them , pretty much on like this til we saved all the changes that we did and then bumm Merge Conflict ...we fixed it but still don't know how it happened lol.*

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide ?**
*Definitly how to do shortcuts through CLI, how to add collaborator on this project, definitely about git fetch origin master , and about git merge origin/master had some confusion on that.*

**What still confuses you about git?**
*Merge conflict and git fetch origin master and git merge origin/master , why use the origin master what is it acctually origin ,, i know master is the branch and why use the slash when merging?*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
*i wanna say pretty awesome :)) ,  all great things for both my pair and our Guide , so helpfull very patient and willing to share their knowledge, hopefullly i did good too lol.*
